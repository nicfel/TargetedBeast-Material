## Overview

Bayesian phylodynamic inference enables reconstruction of pathogen transmission history and evolutionary parameters using genome sequences. However, standard MCMC approaches struggle to scale beyond a few thousand taxa due to inefficient proposal distributions.

The **TargetedBeast** package introduces a set of novel MCMC operators for BEAST2 that:
- Target tree regions with higher mutation density using a pseudo-parsimony score
- Scale node heights more effectively using interval-based operators
- Increase mixing and reduce burn-in, especially for large datasets (e.g., 10,000+ sequences)

This repository contains:
- Scripts and code to reproduce all analyses and figures in the paper
- Benchmarks on simulated and real-world viral datasets
- Operator performance comparisons
- Supplementary figures and data
