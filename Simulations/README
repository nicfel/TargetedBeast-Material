To run the well calibrated simulation studies:

Requirements: BEAST v2.7.7 with TargetedBeast package installed.



Define the sequence length by setting SL environment variable to the desired value. e.g.
export SL=100

Then change directory to 50 or 100 and run the shell script `run.sh`

File information:
50/input.out.xml  BEAST template file
50/results.txt    detailed coverage information -- output of CoverageCalculator and CladeCoverageCalculator.
50/run.sh         script to run a WCSS
50/truth.log      ground truth trace file
50/truth.out.xml  ground truth BEAST XML file
50/truth.trees    ground truth tree fil

100 BEAST XML files:
50/xml/analysis-out0.xml
50/xml/analysis-out1.xml
...
50/xml/analysis-out99.xml


Pre-build summaries are in 
50/xml/run-sl25/summary
50/xml/run-sl50/summary
50/xml/run-sl100/summary
50/xml/run-sl500/summary

For 100 taxa, the same applies to the `100` directory.
